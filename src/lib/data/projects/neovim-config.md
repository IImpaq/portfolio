title: Neovim Config 
date: 2023
url: https://github.com/IImpaq/nvim-config/
preview: During the summer vacations, I wanted to create a comprehensive NeoVim configuration, since I had been using IdeaVim within the Intellij-based IDEs for quite some time. Since the config is very portable, this can be easily reproduced to the repository.
